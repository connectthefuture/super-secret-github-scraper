a project to scrape github and find out a few things:

 * projects with 
   * most frequent commits
   * largest repository
   * most committers

 * members who
   * commit on the most repositories
   * are the most active

Also it would be nice to track things like library usage overtime.  For instance, when did angular or coffeescript become popular amongst the repositories or what version is most widely used.
